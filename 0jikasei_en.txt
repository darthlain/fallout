Let's talk about the creature eggs that you need.
I'll look for your men and supplies.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
(Repair of 35 or higher and one piece of scrap metal required)
For you? Just the basics. Come back when you're a little more seasoned and maybe we could talk about other options.
Well hello, sugar. Mr. House is waiting for you in his office.
First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
Let Jed know you're ready to leave once you're traveling alone and carrying 50 pounds or less.
All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 50 pounds.
But what does that accomplish?
You know that means I'm going to encourage him to leave, right?
If it will get me out of here, sure.
You're the New Canaanite who's supposed to help lead these people, not hide things from them.
While he continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan, he sometimes showed quarter to those who crossed his family.
So, got any rocks then? Or other forms of armamament?
I just hoped a savage - outsider, sorry - would make it to our gates before one of those armies out there comes knocking.
Raquel could use help with the bug problem, Doc Argyll has wounded he's tending to, and Loyal and Jack might be looking for help with some repairs.
Or you could just go see Pete at the museum and hear the story of our people. All you have to do there is listen.
Sheesh, You're one ugly sonofabitch!
If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny, or you're dead.
Ha! Well, you're polite, I'll give you that. If this was just between you and me, I'd do as you ask. But it's not.
Well, well, well! What's our favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
So you're back. Now, where did we leave off?
Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They... they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
McLafferty's a hard boss, but she knows what she's doing, that's for sure.
Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
McLafferty's been riding asses again. Better lay low.
Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.

Just good, honest infantry work! You do 20% more damage with 9mm and .45 Auto Pistols and SMGs, Service Rifles, Assault Carbines, Battle Rifles, Light Machine Guns, Frag Grenades, Grenade Rifles and Launchers, and Combat Knives.
The Flamer that burns twice as bright burns half as long. All weapons have +3% chance to Critically Hit, but equipment condition decays 15% faster.
Perception affects your accuracy with ranged weapons. A high Perception grants a bonus to the Explosives, Lockpick and Energy Weapons skills.
Charisma determines the size of your Party and companion Nerve. Having high Charisma improves people's disposition toward you, and give bonuses to both the Barter and Speech skills.
Agility affects your Guns and Sneak skills. It also determines your reload speed, movement speed, and the number of Action Points available for V.A.T.S.
The Survival skill increases the bonuses and healing received from food and drink. It also helps you create consumable items at campfires.
While using Guns and Energy Weapons, you fire 20% more quickly and AP costs are 20% lower, but your shots are 20% less accurate.
You gain +15 lbs. to your carrying capacity, but suffer a -1 to all attributes any time the weight you're carrying drops below 75 lbs.
You're skilled, but not experienced. You gain +5 points to every skill, but you suffer -15% from experience gained from now on.
You take your time to make every trigger pull count. You are 20% more accurate with Guns and Energy Weapons, but you fire them 20% slower and AP costs are 20% higher.
No one's going to put you out to pasture 'cause you're going to stay young (and level 21) forever! You'll never again become addicted to chems, and they'll last twice as long... but after 21 you can kiss experience, perks, and skill points goodbye!
Would you like to experience these unusual events? Once you select an option, you will not be able to change it.
Buy the ticket, take the ride...
I don't believe in aliens!
Hunting is in your blood. Against animals and mutated animals, you deal +75% Critical Damage and are able to gather more meat and hide from their carcasses.
Survival is the mother of invention! You can now craft large batches of junk ammo at reloading benches using Tin Cans and Scrap Metal.
With each rank of this perk, all of your explosive weapons do an additional 10% damage and have a 10% larger explosion radius.
With the Lead Belly perk, you take 50% less radiation when consuming irradiated food and drink. Your stomach is also built to withstand the negative effects of raw meats.
As a Computer Whiz, you have a much easier time narrowing down possible password choices. You can also attempt to re-hack any computer you were previously locked out of.
You do 15% more damage when using any revolver, lever-action firearm, dynamite, knife, or hatchet.
Just good, honest infantry work! You do 20% more damage with 9mm and .45 Auto Pistols and SMGs, Service Rifles, Battle Rifles, Assault Carbines, Light Machine Guns, Frag Grenades, Grenade Rifles and Launchers, and Combat Knives.
With Infiltrator, bobby pins won't break as easily while lockpicking. Better yet, if a lock is  broken, you can attempt to pick it again one more time. This includes locks previously broken by a "Force Lock" attempt.
You have learned the value of careful packing. Items with a weight of 2 or less weigh 25% less for you.
You can intimidate mobs of opponents into fleeing for their lives. You can trigger this merely with your presence, or through dialogue in some situations.
You've discovered a Shotgun technique that has a chance to knock an enemy back. Shotshells with lower pellet counts have a higher chance of knocking the target down.
You're just so excited about plasma that you can't (magnetically) contain yourself! Attack speeds for all plasma weapons (including grenades) are increased by 20% and AP costs are reduced by 20%.
You're more at home under the open stars than under a roof. Any time you sleep in a bed outside, even for a brief nap, you gain the benefits of being Well Rested.
With each rank of the Life Giver perk, you gain an additional 30 Hit Points.
