Let's talk about the creature eggs that you need.
Could you help me craft something?
I'll look for your men and supplies.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
(Repair of 35 or higher and one piece of scrap metal required)
For you? Just the basics. Come back when you're a little more seasoned and maybe we could talk about other options.
Well hello, sugar. Mr. House is waiting for you in his office.
First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
Let Jed know you're ready to leave once you're traveling alone and carrying 50 pounds or less.
All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 50 pounds.
But what does that accomplish?
You know that means I'm going to encourage him to leave, right?
If it will get me out of here, sure.
You're the New Canaanite who's supposed to help lead these people, not hide things from them.
While he continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan, he sometimes showed quarter to those who crossed his family.
So, got any rocks then? Or other forms of armamament?
I just hoped a savage - outsider, sorry - would make it to our gates before one of those armies out there comes knocking.
Raquel could use help with the bug problem, Doc Argyll has wounded he's tending to, and Loyal and Jack might be looking for help with some repairs.
Or you could just go see Pete at the museum and hear the story of our people. All you have to do there is listen.
I do believe you've conviced one or two of us that it's better you made it here than were blown to smithereens.
I see. Well, thank you for trying. I'm off to go see my admirer now.
Sheesh, You're one ugly sonofabitch!
If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny, or you're dead.
Ha! Well, you're polite, I'll give you that. If this was just between you and me, I'd do as you ask. But it's not.
Well, well, well! What's our favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
So you're back. Now, where did we leave off?
Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They... they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
McLafferty's a hard boss, but she knows what she's doing, that's for sure.
Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
McLafferty's been riding asses again. Better lay low.
Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
I'm unable to work out a deal. The Great Khans are all yours.
I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear.
What were you looking to start?
I'm giving you a real opportunity here - how about some compensation?
You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
I've never seen a robot like that before.
After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
Your friend seems too civilized for a place like this.
New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
Look, Rexie, someone new's come to see us. Poor boy. He hasn't been feeling well lately. I'm the King. What can I do for you?
Maybe so. Maybe so. You look like you might be able to handle yourself. Tell you what.
You do me a favor, and I'll have some more work for you when it's done. Sound good?
You may have noticed that some of those guards out there are Kings, too. I'm just looking out for my men.
I'm not trying to get some kind of unfair advantage. I just want a level playing field for my boys. So what do you say?
Hey, look who it is bringing that good Khan karma around!
While they're in town, the Nightkin aren't allowed to have Stealth Boys so their craziness doesn't get worse.
I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
Because Marcus asked me to and because it's a reason for me to get up in the morning. I'd like to get one more grand accomplishment done.
Something on your mind?
Tell Jerry the Followers will accept him as a novice.
Snuff Tapes
Yeah, this is Clanden. This guy is one sick motherfucker. The way I see it, you have a few options.
One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
Snipers and sharpshooters have been assigned to key locations and we also have a special K9 unit sniffing out members of the crowd.
Not all of them.
Why the lockdown?
I'm so excited about the President visiting. This is going to be great!
I'm looking forward to seeing the President.
I'm just glad to have the day off for this.
I wonder what President Kimball is going to talk about today.
We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.
Today, you are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. You are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring.
That was a great speech.
It was such an honor to be here today. I'm so lucky.
President Kimball is really well spoken.
That's a nice suit President Kimball had.
Maybe they'll let you back in?
But ghouls are immune to radiation.
But he isn't feral.
I could ask you the same thing.
I can take care of that robot problem for you. Just saying.
What can I do for you?
Okay, I'll do that.
No, not really.
That's not necessary.
You were a pilot?
That's not a good idea.
Done. Here's the caps.
What's going on around here?
Mind yourself on the plank going down.
Yeah! Who won the lottery? I did!
Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like booze!
What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
Only lottery that matters! Oh my God, smell that air!
Powder Ganger? What? I mean, yeah, used to be, sure!
But not no more! Powder Gang is small-time, man! I'm a winner! I won the motherfucking lottery!
Stop bothering me, will ya! I won the fucking lottery!
You're the courier who's caused so much trouble for my Legion, and yet you dare come before me.
The Kings of Freeside are cooperating with the NCR now, which frees up soldiers to defend the dam.
So tell me this, because I really want to know. I am feared - with good reason.
But you - of all people - dare to come here and stand before me, the mighty Caesar. What were you thinking?
I need to get that Platinum Chip back.
I had to see the Mighty Caesar with my own eyes.
Uh, citizen, I guess.
Courier.
What's been going on in town lately?
I shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and I'd rather not get you into the habit of crossing the NCR.
How me help you?
What's going on with the Great Khans?
I may be able to negotiate a deal with the Great Khans.
What did you and Boone's wife argue about?
What's going on, man?
I heard there was a sniper nest up here.
The White Legs want to join the Legion. Caesar's rite of passage is the destruction of the New Canaanites, almost assuredly because of me.
Hoi!
Goot.
Yah ah tahg.
What Joshua wants is more than an attack. He wants a slaughter. And he needs more than you and the Dead Horses to do it.
Outman! Kuna-man mad! He kill all White Legs! You talk! You stop!
I love fighting. I'm going back out there now.
What's with the snowglobe collection?
Contracted pupils, involuntary spasms... Med-X kills quickly, Joana. I can help.
You worked in Gomorrah as a Croupier, uh? What was it like?
What did you say about working at Gomorrah?
Don't worry, I'll tell him that you are happy to hear from him.
We'll take care of Carlitos, don't worry.
Carlitos says he's ready to cash in his chips.
The Beards will be there.
You've made it! Thatks so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
Carlitos is trading what he stole for Joana. I was hired to see that he does.
Your boss kept it a secret. Carlitos would've not dealt directly with Omertas.
I don't know how we pulled this off. For a minute there, I thought we were not going to make it.
Let's get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I'm taking the shot. You don't like that, you're on your own.
Okay. No sense keeping you in bed anymore. Let's see if we can get you on your feet.
Sure can. The NCR was founded from the survivors of one of the great Vaults. We started as a small settlement called Shady Sands.
I wouldn't head that direction if I were you, though. Got critters up there that don't take kindly to getting shot.
Stick to the roads when you can, and steer clear of the hills north of Goodsprings. The critters up there are big and poisonous.
I hear rumors, that's about it. Supposedly they keep slaves and they got some real nasty ways of killing folks.
I was out for a stroll that night when I heard the commotion up at the old bone orchard. Saw what looked like a bunch of bad eggs so I laid low.
Happy trails!
To my dismay, they found me while I waited in the shadows and brought me here.
I said, sure as lack of rain, you were still kicking. Then he turned down the job, just like that. I asked if he was sure, it was good money.
Do you know who he was? Where he went?
No idea. Sounds like you two had a history for him to act like that. And turn down the money, too.
Also, if you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
Looks like we got a new visitor in the ol' Brahmin pen. Not many people coming here in a hurry, only passing through.
And if you're passing through, you picked a bad time. Road north has gone to hell, and if I let a caravan through, they won't make it.
Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over.
I will. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
Fucking Mojave's going to hell, and all I can do is sit here and watch.
Caesar's Legion sends skirmishers every so often. Prodding for weaknesses, mostly. The reality is, if they really wanted it, we'd all be dead.
The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
Keeping watch, mostly. Trying to make sure the dangers of this plant are minimized.
How do you like serving in the Army?
Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
Take your time. Pick your shots and tell your squadmates who you're shooting at.
Well, I think that went well, don't you?
Okay, to start, pull the pin, let it cook off for a count of three, then throw.
Any idea why they went that way?
No clue. I know Benny hadn't paid up yet. Maybe that was where they were supposed to get square.
Hope that helps. I owed you.
I don't blame anybody for it. There's so much chaos when you're fighting, you're lucky not to shoot your own guys.
We've got a situation with some Great Khans right now. The brass at McCarran has ordered me to lock down the ruins until it's been resolved.
Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are, but considering that the hostages are as good as dead when we attack...
Don't worry about me. I can handle myself in a fight.
Look at it this way - nobody dies.
Destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam a couple of years ago. The town was set up as a trap for Caesar's Legion.
I think you'd better leave.
Just making friendly conversation.
Do you treat everyone around here like this?
I don't see how that affects me.
You'd think the NCR would be very concerned about this sort of thing.
Tech Sergeant Reyes
What's your take on the NCR's position here?
But it's understandable. The constant skirmishes take their toll on everyone in the end.
Let's move out!
Hand over the Platinum Chip, maybe you live.
Why would I trust you?
Well, the Legion is going to attack Hoover Dam one of these days! And the NCR is going to defend it!
To the northeast is a settlement, the locals here call them "Boomers." They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
You don't strike me as someone down on their luck. What brings you to Westside?
I help tend the crops, stand watch for Fiends, and generally help keep things civilized.
Whoa there, pal. You better slow down, or you'll get blown up like the rest of the idiots who thought they'd scavenge in Boomer territory.
Except you! There's something special about you, child, and it was the howitzers that gave you a chance to show it.
Oh, so many ways! Small ones to begin with, so we can get used to what it's like to have a sav- outsider around and about.
Then, about a week ago, there was a scientist. Keely. She's unusual, not the sort of person you'd expect, but she's an absolute genius, and...
And Hildern hates Keely because... well, because every time they meet, she makes him look like an ass. In front of important people, usually.
Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
They've set up shop in Vault 3 to the west. Every day they attack our positions and my men repel them.
The Legion's been sending raiding parties across the river in larger numbers lately. We don't have the men at this post to intercept them all.
Does the Legion know you're watching them from here?
That guy Benny was a piece of work.
What was  that about the surplus ammo?
You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
Every station except Charlie has been given the new security codes. Charlie was wiped out.
That's horrible!
He's usually down around the proving ground if you want to say yo.
Hey there. In from out of town, ain't you? Name's Dusty.

Your strong impartiality to the whims of society allows you to resist what the world throws at you. You gain +15% to Fire, Poison, and Radiation resistances...so long as you maintain a Neutral Karma level.
You're right, I should have never doubted you!
A runaway dad, huh? I've seen plenty of them before. But none with a big "101" on their back. Good luck finding him.
Maybe the Armored Vault Suit will help you out there, huh?
I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them.
Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine. And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
You got an armament supply? Want to do some trading?
You'll be wanting the reward now, won't you. I suppose you've earned it.
Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself.
Here, take a bit, my treat - they taste kind of grates after a while.
My boys are huntin' 'Lurks. Finest meat you can get, but it don't move around in your stomach like Mole Rat does.
With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Oh, Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it. But I doubt it.
The Brotherhood does its best, but sometimes it takes a little something... special. That's where the Lyons' Pride comes in.
You got a Pip-Boy. Tune into Galaxy News Radio and listen. It's the only radio station in the Capital Wasteland that really tells it like it is.
Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside of D.C. can hear her cry.
It's the dish off the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
Step outside the city limits, and it's snake city... nothing but "hissssssss."
Where's Doctor Li's lab?
I'm Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your father many years ago. Your mother as well, in fact.
The Commonwealth itself is nothing but a war-ravaged quagmire of violence and despair. Inside the sealed environment of the Institute, however...
But... the Institute's affairs are none of your concern. Your undeveloped mind couldn’t even begin to comprehend what we’ve accomplished.
My God, I... I remember. I remember it all. From before. Zimmer. The Commonwealth. The Institute. My God, all those runners I brought down...
There was a holotape that got circulated. I think I've got a copy of it...
Yeah, here it is. Give it a listen. That's a man's voice! Hoax for sure!
Some say it was all a hoax. But it's real.
Here. Check out this holotape I found. That Commonwealth robot was real!
Please re-dress in your Vault-Tec issued Vault suit before proceeding.
We used the old Jefferson Memorial for the location, right on D.C.'s Tidal Basin. Someday soon, I hope you'll see it work.
That's why it's so important to find a G.E.C.K. as soon as possible. It's the key to Project Purity.
There had always been something of a "mutants problem" in the city, but it became worse. They attacked more frequently, and more aggressively.
Be careful, my son.
Hello, stranger. I'm Tinker Joe, premier supplier of robotic parts and service throughout the D.C. Wasteland.
I didn't want to have to do this...
You haven't lost any of your passion, have you James?
It's as important to me as ever, Madison. I know it's important to you too. Let's finish it together.
With the fuses in place, you should be able to access the mainframe. No need to come back to the control room; just head straight there.
Everyone, listen; it seems we have some visitors. I don't know who they are or what they want.
I'd like to thank you all for returning to this project after so many years. I know some of you thought; like me, that this day would never come.
I'm sorry, but that's...
What? What are you talking about? That doesn't even make sense...
James... Your father caused an overload. He sacrificed himself to keep the Enclave from getting the purifier, and to buy us some time to escape.
In all that time, all we've managed to do is to contain the threat. Hold them back, so they don't overrun every blasted settlement out here.
Initiate! You've got a lot of nerve interrupt... Oh, my apologies, stranger. I thought you were one of these worthless Initiates.
Perk Added
Why do you think I ride these Initiates so hard? I make training hell so fighting those Uglies won't be.
It is the Scribes, the Scribes who make the Brotherhood what it truly is! The brawn is useless without the brain, hmm? He he he.
How about we skip the story and you just tell me what you want?
Does it involve caps? I really like caps. Like, a lot.
As long as there's caps involved, I'm in. Mmmm.... caps.
Caps and the promise of mysterious compensation? I'm in.
Oh, you. Of course we are. And I think I'm really capturing that snide wit of yours. So, for all your snippiness, I think it'll help with the book.
We're in the last stretch, now, so let's finish it up strong! What's first?
Ah, I do love meetings so much. I think I'll bring muffins!
Look, I know I've asked a lot of you already, but you have to find that kid... he deserves better than all this.
You're not... not here to try and steal my secrets are you?
My oh my, that would be tempting. If you were that good, maybe I'd pay you! Ha ha ha.
But don't tell Vance I said that.
If you wish to speak to Ian, you are free to do so.
Even if all of us look different on the outside, we all have had the same vice infesting our insides.
I'm afraid Vance has him in isolation and there's no way I'm going to override Vance's orders.
I've tried to use it to get whatever I need, but I've never gotten a reply.
As promised, here's the key to the ammunition box. It's right under the radio table.
Yes, I'd imagine it would fetch an incredible sum of caps to someone that was knowledgeable in muscial history.
I doubt the average merchant would even realize what they're holding.
The, um... Mechanist and the AntAgonizer. That's just what they call themselves. It's ridiculous, I know...
You mean Scott Wollinski. I refuse to call him by that ridiculous name just because his head got a screw loose.
Just stumbled into town? You sure picked a fine day for it, with the crazies out there.
Here, have a drink on the house. Welcome to Canterbury.
Oh man! Did you see it? Did you see it? The AntAgonizer was all like, "Fear me!" But the Mechanist was all, "Stop, evil-doer!"
Ever since then, he's been up on his Forge in the back of the robot shop on the hill, working to protect us all from the AntAgonizer!
I've never been anywhere else, so I can't really say, but yeah it's okay.
The Mechanist used to be our town mechanic. Scott Wollinski, quiet guy, but plenty fierce with a wrench and some solder.
Well, the world broke just like the glass. And everyone's trying to put it back together like it was, but it'll never come together the same way.
Alright sure, why not. The people have a tendency to wait until the last minute to vote, but I'd like just to get it over with.
Never mind. Just thought I'd ask.
So, what are the results?
Can you believe that you won the election?
